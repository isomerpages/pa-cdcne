<p>As the curtains close on another spectacular edition of Shaping Hearts,
we look back on this journey we’ve embarked on together!</p>
<p>Shaping Hearts 2024 was not only Singapore’s largest inclusive arts festival
but also a true celebration of the spirit, strength, and creativity of
our “Heartists”—artists with disabilities who have surmounted challenges
to create inspiring works of art. The three-week festival spotlighted over
500 artworks created by over 200 artists from Singapore and ten international
cities worldwide. The festival boasted captivating art exhibitions, exciting
live performances, art sales, and a heartwarming charity art auction.</p>
<p>A highlight of the event was the debut of the Neo Kah Kiat Arts Awards,
an unprecedented initiative supported by a S$1 million, five-year commitment
from Mr. Neo Kah Kiat, Founder of Neo Group. With awards such as the Neo
Kah Kiat Painting of the Year and various recognition categories, the awards
provide both recognition and financial rewards to artists across different
stages of their creative journeys.</p>
<p>Additionally, NE CDC extended its impact through various 2024 initiatives,
including a partnership with SMRT to showcase Shaping Hearts artworks in
public spaces, promoting visibility and awareness for artists with disabilities.</p>
<p>Through these collective efforts, the festival raised over S$XX to support
artists with disabilities, strengthening NECDC’ commitment to fostering
awareness, acceptance, and community support for the special needs community.</p>
<p>Proceeds will help fund future inclusive arts initiatives, opening doors
for artists to continue their creative pursuits.</p>
