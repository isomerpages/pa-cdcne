Our adorable You Kang just celebrated his 1-year-old birthday last week. We are so glad we could bring him big smiles through our North East Growth Fund.

The North East Growth Fund provides support to You Kang’s family by helping them defray the cost of milk powder and diapers. “I only recently started as a Grab driver and was without a job before that. This fund really helped us a lot,” shared Mr Lim, You Kang’s father.

Mr Lim learnt about the fund through a North East CDC volunteer who visits them regularly. He is very grateful to the volunteer who helped him out with the paperwork for fund application.

You can play your part in helping You Kang and other children like him grow up well and healthy.
