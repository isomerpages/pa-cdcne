We're thrilled to share the return of our annual Shaping Hearts event, the largest inclusive arts festival in Singapore that celebrates the power of inclusivity and artistic diversity!

* Our Tampines Hub: 11 November to 26 November 2023
* One Punggol: 18 November to 3 December 2023

Shaping Hearts 2023 is more than just an arts exhibition; it's a celebration of the extraordinary talents of "Heartists" with disabilities. 
These talented individuals have overcome challenges and created remarkable artworks that tell their stories of strength and resilience. 

The festival features a captivating art exhibition, live performances, art sales, and a heartwarming charity art auction, all in the spirit of promoting awareness, acceptance, and inclusivity within our community.
