“Everything was nice when we came back!”

Madam Rozanah felt an indescribable joy when she returned home to a refreshed environment. ✨ For a long time, medical problems have prevented her and her elderly parents from improving the conditions of their home. The family’s wish for a better living condition finally came true with the help of volunteers and partner of Young NTUC-North East CDC Project Refresh, SP HOMES.

After several sessions of cleaning, a new coat of paint, and customised furnishing that catered to their needs, home is now a cosier and safer space for Madam Rozanah’s family. 😊
