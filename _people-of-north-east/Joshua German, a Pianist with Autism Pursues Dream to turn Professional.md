Unlike many of us, Joshua finds it tough to express himself in a conversation. But give him a piano and you’ll hear the beautiful notes of his thoughts and dreams, loud and clear. 🎹🎶🧡

Though Joshua grows up with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the immense support of his family gives him the courage to develop his talent for music. “I hope in the future he can have a place to go to where he’s taken care of,” shared Mrs Ong, Joshua’s grandmother.

With our community coming together to create an inclusive space, differently-abled talents like Joshua will be able to pursue their dreams.
