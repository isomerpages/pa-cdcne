This collaboration is anchored on the key notion of bringing jobs for persons with intellectual disabilities (PWIDs) into the North East District, ensuring that these individuals are gainfully employed at a work location near their homes, with the aim to create community jobs experience for PWIDs, as to build up their confidence and capabilities for future employment.
