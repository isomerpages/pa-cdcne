*Collecting seashells from the seashore. Going to the seaside has always been one of my favourite pastimes. I made more memories there, such as having picnics, paying in the seawater, digging sandpits and collecing clams. Picnic mats, beach buckets are some essential things to bring. I hope to use these items to collect more memories from seasides.*
