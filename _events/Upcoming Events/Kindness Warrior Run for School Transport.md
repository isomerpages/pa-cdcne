Run for a good cause - raise funds for primary and secondary school students from lower-income families by taking part in the Kindness Warrior Run for School Transport!

Jointly organised by Northeast CDC and TOP International Holding, this 5KM run aims to support students in offsetting the essential cost of transportation. All proceeds raised through the signup fee of $30 per participant go towards the North East CDC School Transport Subsidy Scheme.

Join us on **23 October 2022** at **Temasek Polytechnic**! Rally your families to participate as well. Let's get moving in making a difference for our students.
