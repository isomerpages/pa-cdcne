North East CDC continues to help the lower-income families with its new School Transport Subsidy Scheme. After a survey with the 74 schools in North East District, it was noted that there is a prevailing need to provide transportation relief for the students.

The scheme aims to lighten the burden of transportation costs and ease the pressure of daily expenses for families with Primary and Secondary school-going children especially during the trying times of COVID-19. Each eligible student will receive transport subsidy of **$180 ($15 per month) for one year.**
