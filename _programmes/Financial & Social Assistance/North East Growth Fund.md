Every child deserves a healthy start in life. But for low-income families, meeting the nutritional needs and wellness of their little ones is a daily challenge.Â 

The North East Growth Fund was set up to provide formula milk and diapers to young children up to 6 years old. By defraying the costs of these essentials, the wellbeing and good health of our little ones are not compromised.
