Every child deserves a healthy start in life. But for low-income families, meeting the nutritional needs and wellness of their little ones is a daily challenge. 

The North East Growth Fund was set up to provide formula milk and diapers to young children up to 6 years old. By defraying the costs of these essentials, the wellbeing and good health of our little ones are not compromised.

This financial support is acquired through NE CDC’s fundraising efforts, through various campaigns (across different platforms) to drive donations and public support. 

The North East Growth Fund aims to provide financial support for families with young children, enabling them to meet their children’s immediate and practical needs.
