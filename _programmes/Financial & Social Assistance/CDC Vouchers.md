Every Singaporean household will receive $300 CDC Vouchers in June 2024. This is in addition to the $500 CDC Vouchers given on 3 January 2024. Therefore, all Singaporean households will receive a total of $800 CDC Vouchers this year.

The CDC Vouchers Scheme 2024 (June) is part of the enhancements to the Assurance Package announced by then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong at Budget 2024.  The package provides more immediate support for Singaporean households and helps defray daily expenses.

This is part of the enhanced support as part of Budget 2022 and Budget 2023, as well as the $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Package in September 2023.
