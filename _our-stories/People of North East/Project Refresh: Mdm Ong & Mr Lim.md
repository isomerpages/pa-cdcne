Mdm Ong and Mr Lim are true friends who support each other through their respective health challenges! Understanding how their mobility issues have made it tough for them to maintain their home environment, our community came together through Young NTUC â€“ North East CDC Project Refresh to make Mdm Ong and Mr Limâ€™s living space better.

Thank you SP HOMES for customising furniture suited for our beneficiariesâ€™ needs, and a big shoutout to all our volunteers who joined us in making a difference! ðŸ’™
