<p>Dear Residents of North East District,</p>
<p>Warmest greetings to everyone!</p>
<p>I am honoured to build on Mr Desmond Choo’s work over the last eight years
to serve this vibrant and diverse community. North East has long been home
to passionate individuals and families from all walks of life. Together,
we have built a district that puts our care into action.</p>
<p>At North East CDC, we remain deeply committed in meeting real needs. Programmes
such as WeCare, Transport Subsidy, and the Growth Fund are designed to
support our lower-income families and those who may not qualify for national
assistance schemes but still need a helping hand. These are not just policies
– they are concrete action that we develop, based on the feedback from
you and your grassroots advisors.</p>
<p>We also know that the challenges our residents face today are more complex.
Whether it is cost of living, evolving job demands, caring for ageing loved
ones, or ensuring access for persons with disabilities, these concerns
require more than one-size-fits-all solutions. That is why we are working
closely with community partners to co-create targeted programmes that offer
practical and timely support.</p>
<p>CDCs’ role is not only to administer assistance. We are also here to connect
people, pool resources, build capabilities and spark new possibilities.
We cannot do this alone, as building a strong, connected community takes
all of us to work together.</p>
<p>Let us continue making North East a home where everyone feels heard, supported
and empowered to contribute. If you have ideas, stories, or feedback to
share, I invite you to reach out to us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Northeast_CDC@pa.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Together, let’s write the next chapter for North East — one that is compassionate,
inclusive, and filled with opportunities for all.</p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br><strong>Baey Yam Keng</strong>
<br>Mayor, North East District</p>
