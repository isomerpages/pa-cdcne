A programme to support home-based business owners, Fresh Start Market provides participants with a platform to sell their items and widen their customer base. This could be either through an e-commerce platform, or a physical space at Our Tampines Hub.

This service is provided at no costs to participants, enabling them to increase their profits from the sale of their items.
