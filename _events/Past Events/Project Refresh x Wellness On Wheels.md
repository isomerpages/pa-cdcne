<p>The recent wave of Project Refresh and Wellness on Wheels marked a significant
and impactful day for both volunteers and those they served. This community-driven
initiative brought together a dedicated group of volunteers who worked
tirelessly to support less privileged families and seniors in need.</p>

<p>As part of the Wellness on Wheels initiative, delivery trucks filled with
essential health supplies were stationed at carparks in different neighborhoods
across the North East district. The goal was to make things easier for
residents, especially elderly folks, by reducing the need to travel. Volunteers
were on hand to help distribute the supplies directly to seniors and families
in need, ensuring they got the support they required with as much convenience
as possible.</p>

<p>Alongside the ongoing Wellness on Wheels initiative, Project Refresh was
also in action. Volunteers worked hard to help families revitalise their
living spaces, handling everything from painting walls to tidying up, ensuring
that homes became more comfortable and inviting.</p>
