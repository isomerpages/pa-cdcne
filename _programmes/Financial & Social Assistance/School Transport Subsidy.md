The School Transport Assistance and Relief Scheme (STARS) offers financial assistance to students in Primary, Secondary School, and Tertiary education levels, which encompasses Universities, Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, and the Institute of Technical Education. The scheme supports students residing in the North East district who face challenges in accessing transportation to school.
