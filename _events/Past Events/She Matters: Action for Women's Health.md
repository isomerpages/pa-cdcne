Residents sat down for an informative sharing from Dr Veronique Tan, Koh Chieung Mun, Sue Kassim and Sharon Ismail on navigating breast cancer, stories of resilience through the difficult journey and encouragement to go for mammogram screenings. Residents also visited the participating partner booths, to learn more about cancer and the wide range of support available.
