<p>At North East CDC, we are committed to celebrate and uplift artists with
disabilities. We introduced two prestigious awards: one recognising overall
artistic achievement, and another honouring excellence in painting.</p>
<h4><strong>Kiat Lim-Shaping Hearts Awards</strong></h4>
<p>The Kiat Lim-Shaping Hearts Award is designed to nurture artists with
disabilities throughout their artistic journey, from early education to
professional development. The award consists of a scholarship, bursary
and early intervention grant category to provide financial assistance for
persons with disabilities to pursue art. It recognises the artistic achievements
of persons with disabilities (PWDs) and aims to make art education more
accessible, especially for those facing financial constraints. The award
is supported by a S$1,000,000 commitment over five years from Kiat Lim,
a new patron of Shaping Hearts. The funds ensure that PWDs can access opportunities
to facilitate their artistic pursuits, empowering them to explore their
creativity and develop essential skills for personal growth and development.</p>
<p>Application for 2025 Awards open now until 28 Feb 2025: <a href="https://Go.gov.sg/klsha25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/klsha25</a>

<h4><strong>Neo Kah Kiat Arts Award</strong></h4>
<p>The Neo Kah Kiat Arts Awards recognise artistic excellence among artists
with disabilities. This award celebrates diverse talents across various
art disciplines, showcasing exceptional work by persons with disabilities
and promotes inclusivity. By honouring these achievements, we aim to elevate
the visibility of artists with disabilities and their valuable contributions
to the arts community.</p>
