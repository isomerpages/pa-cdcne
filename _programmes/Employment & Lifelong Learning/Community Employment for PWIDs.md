Community Employment Programme â€“ Inclusive Employment is a partnership by North East CDC and MINDS to generate employment for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs) within the community.  This collaboration is anchored on the key notion of bringing jobs for PWIDs into the North East District. The programme allows these individuals to be gainfully employed at a work location near their homes, with the aim to provide work exposure for PWIDs, so as to build up their confidence and capabilities for future employment.
