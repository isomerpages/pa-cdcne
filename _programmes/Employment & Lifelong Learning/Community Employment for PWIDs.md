The Community Employment Programme – Inclusive Employment (CEP-IE) is a partnership by North East CDC and MINDS to generate employment for persons with intellectual disabilities within the community.

This collaboration is anchored on the key notion of bringing jobs for persons with intellectual disabilities (PWIDs) into the North East District, ensuring that these individuals are gainfully employed at a work location near their homes, with the aim to create community jobs experience for PWIDs, as to build up their confidence and capabilities for future employment.
