<p>Every child deserves a healthy start in life. But for low-income families,
meeting the nutritional needs and wellness of their little ones is a daily
challenge.</p>
<p>The North East Growth Fund was set up to provide formula milk and diapers
to young children up to 6 years old. By defraying the costs of these essentials,
the wellbeing and good health of our little ones are not compromised.</p>
