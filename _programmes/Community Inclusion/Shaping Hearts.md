An inclusivity arts festival that is held annually, Shaping Hearts celebrates the numerous artistic talents (visual and performing arts) of the special needs community. Through this festival, North East CDC hopes to provide beneficiaries with a platform to pursue their interests in the arts. The key programme elements include: an art exhibition, live performances, a virtual art sale and an NFT auction.Â

Through Shaping Hearts, North East CDC aims to increase awareness and support for differently-abled artists, and the larger special needs community. It also hopes to garner support from corporate sponsors, partners and individuals for differently-abled artists, in the form of donations to support this cause.
