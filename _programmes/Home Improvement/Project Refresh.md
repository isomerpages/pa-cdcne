Initiated in 2016, Project Refresh aims to enhance the living environment of seniors and low-income families in the North East District through a series of refurbishment works, including painting, cleaning, and decluttering. 

In addition to home refurbishment works, the North East CDC partners with corporate organizations and sponsors to provide essential items such as groceries, household appliances, and furniture to beneficiaries. We also work closely with key partners such as Young NTUC to recruit and mobilise volunteers, providing them with a platform to assist residents in a meaningful way.
