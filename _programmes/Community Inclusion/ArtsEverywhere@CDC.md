<h3>About ArtsEverywhere@CDC</h3>

a greater appreciation for the arts through these shared experiences.</p>
<p>ArtsEverywhere@CDC is a collaboration between the National Arts Council,
People's Association,&nbsp;and the five Community Development Councils,
and is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.</p>
