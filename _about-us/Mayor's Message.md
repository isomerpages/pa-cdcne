Dear Residents,
 
Greetings from the North East CDC!
 
At North East, we are driven by our mission to build a caring and inclusive community. Our team has been actively listening to concerns on the ground to develop programmes and schemes to plug the gaps of our residentsâ€™ emerging needs. We recognise the importance for our localised initiatives to be responsive to increasingly complex social landscape as we face issues including rising costs of necessities, a fast-changing labour market, an aging population, and the need for an inclusive society that embraces diversity.
 
Through schemes like WeCare, Transport Subsidy and North East Growth Fund, we provide interim financial assistance to support our lower-income residents, as well as those who fall marginally out of the lower-income bracket. Strengthening our social resilience does not end here. We work hard to aggregate resources and relevant partners to amplify our social capital, so more can be done for our community.

We have put in great efforts to develop targeted programmes such as Project Refresh, Job Placement Centres, Shaping Hearts and more, to support different groups in the community, including less privileged families, unemployed individuals, persons with disabilities and their caregivers. We aim to leave no one behind.
 
There is much more we can do when we come together to uplift our community, and I would like to invite you to join us in this journey to co-create, collaborate and contribute to a better North East. If you have an idea or something to contribute, do not hesitate to write to us at [Northeast_CDC@pa.gov.sg](Northeast_CDC@pa.gov.sg).
 
Yours sincerely,

Desmond Choo, Mayor of North East District
