Supported by People’s Association Youth Movement (PAYM) and Youth Taskforce by Young NTUC, Careers Unmasked is an annual event organised by North East CDC, which aims to engage youths from ITEs, Polytechnics, and Universities to debunk career myths and explore available options and alternatives upon graduation.

This year’s edition of Careers Unmasked took place at the National Gallery Singapore on 24 September, where participants had the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the different industries from guest speakers such as Annette Lee - Filmmaker, Actress and Musician, Cheryl Wee - Founder of Cheryl W Wellness & Weight Management and Operations Manager of Jean Yip Group, Fern Nannaphat - Country Manager of ShopBack (Singapore), and Stanley Wong - Head of Training Services (APAC) of BridgingMinds Network.

After the breakout sessions and panel discussion with the speakers, the event ended off with engaging fringe activities during the networking buffet session where participants got to receive personalised career advice from industry partners at the booths. The first 20 participants who signed up for the event also had a free makeover by Jean Yip Group, followed by their professional headshots taken on-site to elevate their CVs and LinkedIn profiles!

A huge thank you to those who joined us for this year’s Careers Unmasked, and we hope that you have gained some key takeaways from this insightful session! Full photos [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=NECDC&set=a.463684809127210).
