<p>Launched as part of the 24th edition of Project Refresh, our <strong>Wellness on Wheels</strong> mobile
health supplies truck embarked on its journey, bringing essential items
to the doorsteps of more than 350 seniors from low-income families across
the North East district.</p>

<p>Seniors were able to select from a range of health supplies, including
adult diapers, medicinal plasters, and healthier groceries like milk and
fruits.</p>

<p>This initiative was brought to life through the invaluable partnership
with Hao Ren Hao Shi and the generous donation from Geoscan Pte Ltd. Their
contributions have been instrumental in making this year-long programme
successful, ensuring that essential health resources are readily accessible
to our seniors.</p>
