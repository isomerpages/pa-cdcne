Rise and shine for a plate of piping hot chwee kueh topped with fragrant chai poh (preserved radish) at Aunty Chwee Kueh! Located at Tampines Round Market and Food Centre (Blk 137 Tampines St 11), the stall run by Aunty Kelly and Uncle Andrew opens for business by 6am daily. They also serve up a variety of Teochew kuehs, which make perfect bites for a satisfying tea-break. ❤️😋

Say hi to the friendly couple when you drop by and don’t forget to use your CDC voucher at the stall! 😉
