<p>At North East CDC, we are committed to celebrate and uplift artists with
disabilities. We introduced two prestigious awards: one recognising overall
artistic achievement, and another honouring excellence in painting.</p>
<p><strong>Apply for the Kiat Lim-Shaping Hearts Awards </strong><a href="https://form.gov.sg/68d0ca6c26128e0ec34f17aa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><strong> by 28 February 2026.</strong>

<h4><strong>Kiat Lim-Shaping Hearts Awards</strong></h4>
<p>The Kiat Lim-Shaping Hearts Awards is designed to nurture artists with
disabilities throughout their artistic journey, from early education to
professional development. The awards consists of scholarship, bursary and
early intervention grant categories to provide financial assistance for
persons with disabilities to pursue art. It recognises the artistic achievements
of persons with disabilities (PWDs) and aims to make art education more
accessible, especially for those facing financial constraints. The awards
are supported by a S$1,000,000 commitment over five years from Kiat Lim,
a new patron of Shaping Hearts. The funds ensure that PWDs can access opportunities
to facilitate their artistic pursuits, empowering them to explore their
creativity and develop essential skills for personal growth and development.</p>
