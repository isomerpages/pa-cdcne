After a 2-year hiatus, this signature fundraiser finally returned on 28 September 2022 at Orchid Country Club, with Dr. Janil Puthucheary gracing the event. Organised annually by North East CDC, all proceeds raised go towards supporting the CDC's community programmes and assistance schemes.

A golf tournament took place in the afternoon, followed by an appreciation dinner where the highlight of the event - Charity Auction - was held to support assistance programmes administered by North East CDC. The auctioned items include bottles of the finest wines and stunning art pieces by locally renowned artists, Anthony Chua and Hong Sek Chern. The dinner was also accompanied by an Appreciation Ceremony for key donors and partners of North East CDC, and special performances by Music Vox and Chorale from Temasek Polytechnic.

Together with our corporate sponsors and individual donors, a hearty total of $538,139 was raised to uplift the lives of over 2,500 beneficiaries! Our sincere appreciation to our donors for their generosity and unwavering support for the less privileged in our community.
