<p>Shaping Hearts 2024 was not only Singapore’s largest inclusive arts festival
but also a true celebration of the spirit, resilience, and creativity of
our “Heartists”—artists with disabilities who have overcome challenges
to create inspiring works of art. Over the three-week festival, over 500
artworks by over 200 artists from Singapore and ten international cities
worldwide were proudly showcased. The festival featured captivating art
exhibitions, exciting live performances, art sales, and a heartwarming
charity art auction.</p>

<p>A highlight of the event was the debut of the Neo Kah Kiat Arts Awards,
an unprecedented initiative supported by a S$1 million, five-year commitment
from Mr. Neo Kah Kiat, Founder of Neo Group. With awards such as the Neo
Kah Kiat Painting of the Year and various recognition categories, these
awards provide both recognition and financial rewards to artists across
different stages of their journeys.</p>

<p>Additionally, NECDC amplified its impact through several 2024 initiatives,
including a partnership with SMRT to showcase Shaping Hearts artworks in
public spaces, promoting visibility and awareness for artists with disabilities.</p>
<p>Through these collective efforts, the festival raised over S$500,000 to
support artists with disabilities, strengthening NECDC’ commitment to fostering
awareness, acceptance, and community support for the special needs community.</p>
<p>Proceeds will help fund future inclusive arts initiatives, opening doors
for artists to continue their creative pursuits.</p>
