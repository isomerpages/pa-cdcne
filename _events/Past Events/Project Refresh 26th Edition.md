<p>WOW trucks and booths were set up in neighbourhoods where volunteers distributed
daily necessities and essential health supplies to seniors. With support
from partners like Hao Ren Hao Shi and Geoscan Pte Ltd, the booths made
it easier for those in need to access vital assistance.</p>

<p>Volunteers also engaged with the elderly, making the day even more special
with simple activities and heartfelt moments.</p>
<p>This initiative is a beautiful reminder of the power of community and
the impact we can make when we come together to support those who need
it most. Through kindness and collective action, we continue to build a
stronger, more inclusive future for everyone.</p>
