<p>An inclusive arts festival that is held annually, Shaping Hearts celebrates
the artistic talents (visual and performing arts) of the special needs
community. Through this festival, North East CDC provide beneficiaries
with a platform to pursue their interests in the arts. Shaping Hearts features
an art exhibition, live performances and virtual art sales.</p>
<p>North East CDC aims to increase awareness and support for differently-abled
artists, and the larger special needs community. It also hopes to garner
support from corporate sponsors, partners and individuals for differently-abled
artists, in the form of donations to support this cause.</p>
<h4>SUPPORTING AND RECOGNISING ARTISTIC EXCELLENCE</h4>
<p>At North East CDC, we are committed to celebrate and uplift artists with
disabilities. We introduced two prestigious awards: one recognising overall
artistic achievement, and another honouring excellence in painting.</p>
<p><strong>Neo Kah Kiat Arts Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The Neo Kah Kiat Arts Awards recognise artistic excellence among artists
with disabilities. This award celebrates diverse talents across various
art disciplines, showcasing exceptional work by persons with disabilities
and promotes inclusivity. By honouring these achievements, we aim to elevate
the visibility of artists with disabilities and their valuable contributions
to the arts community.</p>
