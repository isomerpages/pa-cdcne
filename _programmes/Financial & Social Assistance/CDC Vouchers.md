With the distribution of CDC vouchers in May 2022, all Singaporean households can now claim $100 worth of CDC vouchers to spend at more than 16,000 participating heartland merchants and hawkers island wide.  
  
Look out for the CDC Vouchers decal displayed at the merchant or hawker stall shopfront, and take this opportunity to explore and get to know your neighbourhood too!
