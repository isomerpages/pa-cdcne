The Heart Bakers @ North East programme equips lower income stay-home mothers and aspiring home bakers with baking, business and marketing skills, to start their own home baking business.

When enrolled in Heart Bakers, participants attend a baking masterclass conducted by a professional chef, where they will learn how to bake cookies using a specially handcrafted recipe. They will also participate in a social media and e-marketing course that equips them with skills to start a home business.

Upon completing the training, participants will bake the cookies for sale. Proceeds from sales goes to the participants to supplement their household income and support them in starting their own business.
