<p>As part of the interactive experience, several audience members were invited
to join the dancers. With joyful smiles all around, they learned and followed
traditional Malay dance choreography.</p>

<p>As the rhythmic beats of the kompang filled the air, the dancers wove
these sounds into a powerful narrative, bringing the music to life through
their expressive movements.</p>
