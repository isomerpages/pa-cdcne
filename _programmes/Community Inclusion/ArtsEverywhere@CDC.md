<p><strong>A Birdâ€™s Journey</strong> 
</p>
<p>Presented by yIN Harmony inspired by the classic story of <em>The Ugly Duckling</em>,
our musicians' quest to discover what "Singapore Music" means mirrors the
duckling's search for its own kind. This performance, accompanied by live
traditional music, weaves in cultural elements unique to Singapore. Audience
members will have the chance to engage interactively by playing the bird
flute, learning Indian dance hand gestures, and folding origami cranes.</p>
