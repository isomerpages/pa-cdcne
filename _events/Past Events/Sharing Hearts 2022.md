Shaping hearts return for the fourth conservative year! 

This year’s two-week inclusive arts festival took place from 12 to 27 November 2022 at Our Tampines Hub, and has even expanded to the new integrated hub, One Punggol! Themed ‘Celebrating Arts. Inspiring Hope’ inspires the community through the creative expressions of our differently-abled artists, with each expression being an embodiment of a milestone they have reached in overcoming their challenges. Residents and invited guests had the opportunity to experience the artists’ works through multiple lenses – art exhibitions, live performances, and an art marketplace – to celebrate the diverse talents of our friends with disabilities. As part of bringing the community together to support inclusivity, the ‘Pledge a Heart’ movement was also launched to encourage others to share their support for persons with disabilities in Singapore.

Shaping Hearts 2022 officially concluded on a high note, with a live art auction for 9 paintings – including the art pieces done in collaboration with local celebrities Edmund Chen, Jaime Teo and Jeanette Aw. With the strong support of corporate and individual donors, we raised over SGD$672,286 for Shaping Hearts 2022! Our deepest appreciation to all our Heartists, SSAs, partners, and donors for making this meaningful event a success.

Over 270 masterpieces by more than 150 Heartists are still up for sale on [Shop (shapinghearts.sg)](https://shop.shapinghearts.sg/shop) from now till 31 December 2022!  Support inclusive arts by purchasing these one-of-a-kind art pieces, where all proceeds go to our Heartists and their social service agencies (SSAs).

Together, let’s continue to work towards building a caring and inclusive society through art.
