Led by Mayor Baey Yam Keng, the North East Community Development Council (NE CDC) aggregates partners and resources to build a district connected in care, where residents are empowered to live better, stay connected, and take collective action for a caring and inclusive society. Through initiatives in social support, family and youth development, digital wellbeing, jobs and learning, NE CDC uplifts lives and strengthens bonds. By bringing together residents, corporate partners, and community organisations, the CDC strives to build a stronger North East where no one is left behind and every generation can shine.
