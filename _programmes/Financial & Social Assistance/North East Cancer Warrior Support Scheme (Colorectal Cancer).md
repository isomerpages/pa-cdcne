<p>In Singapore, Colorectal Cancer is the most common cancer among Men and
Women. FIT (Faecal Immunochemical Test) screening has been proven effective
in reducing deaths from Colorectal Cancer through early detection and treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the success of North East Cancer Warrior Support Scheme for Breast
Cancer, North East Community Development Council (CDC) and SingHealth would
like to deepen the collaboration to enhance the scheme to include colorectal
cancer.</p>
