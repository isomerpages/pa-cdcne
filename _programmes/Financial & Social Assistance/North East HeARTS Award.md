This year, the inaugural Shaping Hearts Art Grant will also be launched to support individuals with disabilities with opportunities for creative expression and personal development through visual arts. The Art Grant will provide additional support for our special needs artists to enable them to pursue their passion and talent in art, regardless of their family background or disability. The Art Grant is expected to benefit over 60 beneficiaries in the first year, with each beneficiary receiving a quantum amount between $2,000 to $5,000, to allow them to continue their passion in art.
