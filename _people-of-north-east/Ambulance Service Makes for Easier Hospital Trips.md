The past 13 years haven't been the kindest to Mdm Hasana. A stroke affected her mobility and a heart attack weakened her. Being diagnosed with brain tumour further complicates her health condition. Having to travel back and forth to different places of regular treatment makes it challenging for her and her husband, who is the key caregiver.

Thankfully, they found out about the Dedicated North East Ambulance Programme, which now makes travelling around manageable. Watch this video to find out how the programme makes a difference to Mdm Hasana's life. ðŸŒˆ

We hope to get your support to donate to the Dedicated NE Ambulance Programme. Every cent counts in paving a smoother journey for our beneficiaries: http://go.gov.sg/dnea
