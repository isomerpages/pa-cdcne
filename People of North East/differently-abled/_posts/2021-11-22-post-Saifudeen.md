Saifudeenâ€™s parents felt something was amiss when they noticed that he tiptoed up the stairs. They hoped his condition would improve but it did not. Saifudeen was eventually diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at age 7.

Soon after, Saifudeen stopped attending school because he felt that he was a burden to his classmates. He stayed home aimlessly until his sister introduced him to Muscular Dystrophy Association Singapore (MDAS). Through MDAS, Saifudeen found his passion for arts and design. ðŸŽ¨

Now, Saifudeen not only creates beautiful masterpieces, he also inspires others as a speaker in schools and corporate events. ðŸ’¯ Saifudeen is also one of the artists featured in Shaping Hearts 2021.
