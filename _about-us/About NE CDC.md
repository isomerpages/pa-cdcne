Set up in 1997, the North East Community Development Council (NECDC) serves a population of over 1,100,000 residents. The North East District spans 21 divisions in Aljunied, Sengkang, Pasir Ris â€“ Punggol, Tampines GRCs, Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

Led by Mayor Baey Yam Keng, NECDC is driven by its mission to create a caring and inclusive community. It creates tailored programs and initiatives to address evolving resident needs, especially in the face of complex social challenges like the rising cost of living, a dynamic job market, an aging population, and the need to foster an inclusive society with a strong social compact. By collaborating with partners and implementing targeted programs, NECDC aims to enhance social capital and provide support to disadvantaged families, children, seniors, unemployed individuals, and people with disabilities, all with the goal of ensuring everyone can thrive and lead better lives in the North East.
