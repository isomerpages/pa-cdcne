<p>With the festive season upon us, Heart Bakers Season 20 @ North East launches,
featuring a Heart Baker alumna sharing her signature recipe through a hands-on
master class.</p>
<p>Treat yourself to the Himalayan Salt Chocolate Cookies, lovingly baked
with a touch of McCormick Himalayan Salt by dedicated Heart Bakers. Each
purchase supports parents from lower-income families as they turn their
baking skills into a meaningful source of income.</p>
<p>Let us celebrate the season with treats that give back, sharing warmth,
joy, and support with the community around us.</p>
