<p>As part of the 24th edition of Project Refresh, our Wellness on Wheels
mobile health supplies truck embarked on its journey, bringing essential
items directly to the homes of more than 350 seniors from low-income families
across the North East district.</p>
<p>These seniors were able to select from a range of health supplies, including
adult diapers, medicinal plasters, and nutritious groceries like milk and
fruits. This initiative was made possible thanks to the collaboration with
Hao Ren Hao Shi and the generous support from Geoscan Pte Ltd. Their contributions
have turned this year-long programme into a reality, ensuring that vital
health resources are within easy reach for our seniors.</p>
<p>Thanks to the combined efforts of our partners, volunteers, and community,
Wellness on Wheels has made a significant difference in the lives of our
seniors. Together, we’re not just delivering supplies—we’re delivering
care, dignity, and hope to those who need it most.</p>
