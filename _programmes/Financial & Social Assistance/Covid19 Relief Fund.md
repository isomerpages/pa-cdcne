Are you facing sudden loss of job or income as a result of Covid-19? The Covid-19 Relief Fund is here to lend a helping hand.

A partnership between the 5 CDCs together with Ngee Ann Kongsi and Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Fund aims to support Singaporeans affected by the pandemic.

The Fund will open for registration from now till 31 March 2023 to help more Singaporeans, including those who are self-employed, cope with rising costs of living and inflationary pressures. Each successful applicant will receive $800 per household.

*Loss of income must have taken place after 23 Jan 2020 when COVID-19 first occurred in Singapore. Applicant must have monthly gross income of $3,000 or less.

Each successful applicant (and his/ her household) will receive a one-time relief of $800.
