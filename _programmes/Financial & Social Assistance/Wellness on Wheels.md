<p>Launched as part of the 24th edition of Project Refresh, our <strong>Wellness on Wheels</strong> mobile
health supplies truck embarked on its journey, bringing essential items
to the doorsteps of more than 350 seniors from low-income families across
the North East district.</p>

<p>These seniors were able to select from a range of health supplies, including
adult diapers, medicinal plasters, and nutritious groceries like milk and
fruits.</p>

<p>This initiative was made possible thanks to the collaboration with Hao
Ren Hao Shi and the generous support from Geoscan Pte Ltd. Their contributions
have turned this year-long programme into a reality, ensuring that vital
health resources are within easy reach for our seniors.</p>
<p>Thanks to the combined efforts of our partners, volunteers, and community,
Wellness on Wheels has made a significant difference in the lives of our
seniors. Together, we’re not just delivering supplies—we’re delivering
care, dignity, and hope to those who need it most.</p>
