SkillsFuture Festival @ North East 2022 shed light on the trends and developments of the growing green sector. With over 100 job roles and 1,000 vacancies offered, residents were introduced to career opportunities in this emerging industry and advice on how they can pivot into green roles across other sectors.

Residents participated in Our Tampines Hub (OTH) Eco-tour where they discovered the numerous eco-friendly activities in OTH. They were also acquainted to the various green spaces in North East such as parks, cycling paths, and playgrounds in Pasir Ris, Punggol, and Tampines.

Career coaches and industry experts were on hand to share on relevant upskilling programmes and the importance of staying relevant in the changing employment landscape. Residents also learnt about sustainable business practices and how to tap on the various resources for their career planning needs. Thank you to all who joined us at the festival, and we hope you enjoyed this green learning journey!
