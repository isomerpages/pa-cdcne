**Kindness Warrior Run for School Transport**

*“The efforts of one person can’t move mountains. It’s the strength of us all working together that makes a change.”*

On 23 October, a grand total of 400 Kindness Warriors gathered at Temasek Polytechnic to run for a good cause! The Kindness Warrior Run for School Transport is a collaboration between TOP International Holding and North East CDC, supported by Temasek Polytechnic, Tampines West Community Sports Network and ALLY. In light of the impending rise in transportation costs, the event managed to raise nearly $50,000 to uplift beneficiaries from our School Transport Subsidy Scheme - helping primary and secondary school students from lower-income families defray their daily transportation expenses.

The 5km fun run was flagged off by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng, along with CEO of TOP International Holding, Dato’ Victor Tan, and Temasek Polytechnic’s CEO and Principal, Mr Peter Lam. All participants also got to bring home a well-deserved finisher medal as a memento for their accomplishment.

Huge thanks to TOP International Holding, Temasek Polytechnic, our participants, and volunteers for being part of this meaningful initiative. A special mention to Chairman and CEO of Mlion Corporation, Mr Eric Leong, for his generous support in this fundraiser too!
