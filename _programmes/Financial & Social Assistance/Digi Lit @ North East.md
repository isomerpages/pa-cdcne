To strengthen the digital literacy capabilities in young children, Digi-Lit @ North East was created for children from low-income families and between the ages of 4 to 9 years old.

For children between 4 to 6 years old, Digi-Lit aims to inspire their love of reading; for children between 7 to 9 years old, the programme aims to increase their awareness of online scams and fake news. This is achieved through the National Library Board (NLB) S.U.R.E framework: Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate. 

Families are also introduced to NLB’s online and offline reading resources, reducing their financial challenges in finding resources for their children’s digital literacy development.
