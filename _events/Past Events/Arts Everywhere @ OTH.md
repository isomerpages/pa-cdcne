<p>Last week, Our Tampines Hub came alive with a vibrant performance by the
Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts, in a beautiful celebration of Malay
cultural dance. As part of the interactive experience, several audience
members were invited on stage to join the dancers. With joyful smiles all
around, they learned and followed traditional Malay dance choreography.
Young participants also had the chance to don the traditional <em>sampin</em> and
dance along, guided warmly by the performers. Adding depth to the event,
the dancers shared insights into the rich cultural history behind Malay
instruments, such as the <em>angklung</em>. Musicians playing the <em>angklung</em> created
a melodic symphony of bamboo, while skilled dancers transformed these sounds
into expressive storytelling through movement.</p>
