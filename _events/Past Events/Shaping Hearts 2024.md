<p>Shaping Hearts 2024 was not only Singapore’s largest inclusive arts festival
but also a true celebration of the spirit, resilience, and creativity of
our “Heartists”—artists with disabilities who have overcome challenges
to create inspiring works of art. Throughout the three-week festival, more
than 500 artworks by over 200 artists from Singapore and ten international
cities worldwide were proudly showcased. The festival featured captivating
art exhibitions, exciting live performances, art sales, and a heartwarming
charity art auction.</p>

<p>A highlight of the event was the debut of the Neo Kah Kiat (NKK) Arts
Awards, an unprecedented initiative supported by a S$1 million, five-year
commitment from the Founder, Chairman, Group CEO of NEO Group, Mr. Neo
Kah Kiat BBM. With awards such as the Neo Kah Kiat Painting of the Year
and various recognition categories, these awards provide both recognition
and financial rewards to artists across different stages of their journeys.</p>

including a partnership with SMRT to showcase Shaping Hearts artworks in
public spaces, promoting visibility and awareness for artists with disabilities.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the overwhelming support from our partners, donors,
and art enthusiasts who joined us in this journey. Together, we raised
over $500,000, a testament to the collective commitment to fostering an
inclusive society. These funds will play a pivotal role in supporting persons
with disabilities in their pursuit of the arts, creating opportunities
for them.</p>
