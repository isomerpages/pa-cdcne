The North East HeARTS Award is the first community-initiated effort to empower persons with disabilities by providing opportunities for creative expression and personal development through the visual arts. It not only celebrates artistic achievements but also serves as a crucial step in making art education more accessible. It ensures that persons with disabilities, particularly those facing financial constraints, can continue to progress and thrive through arts.

In its inaugural year, the North East HeARTS Award is projected to impact 60 beneficiaries. Each recipient will be awarded a quantum amount ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, providing them with the necessary resources to continue their artistic journey.

Application has now closed.
