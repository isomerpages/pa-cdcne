As the curtains close on another spectacular edition of Shaping Hearts, we look back on this journey we've embarked on together!

Shaping Hearts 2023 was not just an arts exhibition, but it was also a celebration of the spirit and talents of our "Heartists" â€“ artists with disabilities who have conquered challenges to create masterpieces that resonate with strength and resilience. Over 150 artists contributed their art, sharing their stories and inspiring all who attended. The festival boasted captivating art exhibitions, exciting live performances, art sales, and a heartwarming charity art auction.

We are grateful for the overwhelming support from our partners, donors, and art enthusiasts who joined us in this journey. Together, we raised close to $500,000, a testament to the collective commitment to fostering an inclusive society. These funds will play a pivotal role in supporting persons with disabilities in their pursuit of the arts, creating opportunities
for them.

Stay tuned for Shaping Hearts 2024!
