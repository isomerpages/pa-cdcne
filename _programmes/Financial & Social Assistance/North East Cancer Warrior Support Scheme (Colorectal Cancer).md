<p>In Singapore, Colorectal Cancer is the most common cancer among men and
women. FIT (Faecal Immunochemical Test) screening has been proven effective
in reducing deaths from Colorectal Cancer through early detection and treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on the success of the North East Cancer Warrior Support Scheme
for Breast Cancer, North East Community Development Council (CDC) and SingHealth
are expanding their collaboration to include colorectal cancer, with a
focus on ensuring patients have peace of mind whilst going through screening,
assessment, diagnosis, treatment and recovery.</p>

provide <strong>up to $15,000 in financial assistance</strong>, should eligible
